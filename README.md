# Welcome ðŸ˜„
My name is Iia (ee-ya, it's Swedish!)
I started learning programming in September 2023 and fell in love!
I am currently looking for work while working on my JavaScript and Python skills in my freetime.

Feel free to talk to me about coffee, linguistics, books, or coding projects ðŸ‘¾
