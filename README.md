# Welcome ðŸ˜„
My name is Iia (ee-ya, it's Swedish!)
I started learning programming in September 2023 through a coding bootcamp at UCF and found that data analysis was my favorite part of the course!
I am currently looking for work while working on my SQL, Excel, and Python skills to switch careers into data!

Feel free to talk to me about coffee, linguistics, books, or SQLprojects ðŸ‘¾
